Everything outside of the "Libraries" folder is MIT licensed, with one stipulation; you cannot use WVU's trademarks.

As a convenience, here is a copy of [WVU's official logo sheet](http://tls.wvu.edu/r/download/23909).

For items inside the "Libraries" folder, please check License.txt or the appropriate file header. They are all permissive open source licenses, though a few require attribution.

Requests
========

If you use my code to make an app, I would appreciate an email, tweet, or message on GitHub, but it is certainly not required.

How to Build
================

1. Clone, Fork, or Download the repository.
1. iWVU uses a private key when connecting to WVU's directory server. If you want the app to build, you can use a [dummy PrivateKey.plist file](http://JaredCrawford.org/Files/PrivateKey.plist). If you would like to add directory support to your application, an iOS compatible LDAP client was created by fellow WVU student Ricky Hussmann for use in early versions of iWVU. This project, [RHLDAPSearch](http://github.com/rhussmann/RHLDAPSearch) is also open source on GitHub.
1. Build away.

Project Status
==============

[Available on the App Store](http://iTunes.com/apps/iWVU)

This app is currently receiving maintenance updates only. I am a law school student and I haven't had time to commit to this app recentry. Because some of the code in this app represents my first foray into Objective-C, I have planned a complete rewrite of the app the next free chance I get.

If you are interested in contributing or taking over lead development, please contact me.
